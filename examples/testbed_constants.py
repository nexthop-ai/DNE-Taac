"""Example testbed device + topology constants.

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for everything device-specific about the example
testbed: hostname, MAC, DUT port wiring, TGEN interfaces and OTG port
locations, IP addressing, and BGP AS numbers. Modeled on
taac/testconfigs/npi/w800_constants.py.

All values are placeholders (example.com hostnames, RFC1918 addressing,
locally-administered MAC) so the example configs build and are importable
without any hardware.

Targeting a real testbed — two options:
  1. Edit the values here (this is the ONLY file that should need
     device-specific edits), or
  2. Leave this file generic and point TAAC_TESTBED_CONSTANTS at a
     site-specific Python file; any names it defines override the values
     below at import time (see the bottom of this module). This keeps
     site-specific hostnames out of the shared examples.

NOTE: the runner still consumes the topology CSVs under examples/topology/
for testbed setup. The interface names below MUST stay in sync with the
corresponding circuit_info.csv rows (single_switch/, single_switch_otg/)
— the CSVs no longer drive the test configs, but they do drive
port classification and health-check scoping.

Consumed by: simple_connectivity_test.py, agent_restart_test.py,
bgp_session_test.py, traffic_forwarding_test.py (each adds its own
directory to sys.path to import this module, since examples/ is not a
package).
