    FAILs if the current steady RSS exceeds the in-run baseline steady RSS by

    becomes a tracked time series, so cross-version creep of the baseline itself

    The transient CPU characterization today is ``peak = running max`` over the

    spike (bgpd briefly pegs a core during EOR/RIB compute) trips the gate even
