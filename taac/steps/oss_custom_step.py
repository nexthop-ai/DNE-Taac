"""OSS implementation of ``StepName.CUSTOM_STEP``.

The Meta build takes ``CustomStep`` from ``taac.internal.steps.custom_step``,
which is not part of the OSS slice. Without a replacement ``NAME_TO_STEP`` has
no CUSTOM_STEP entry at all, so ``TaacRunner._initialize_step`` dies on
``NAME_TO_STEP[step.name]`` with a bare ``KeyError(StepName.CUSTOM_STEP)``:
the stage ends in 0.0s before its first step runs and the playbook reports
``<StepName.CUSTOM_STEP: 1001>`` as its whole error. Observed on hardware for
npi_cpu_036/037/038 (unresolved next hop) and npi_cpu_039 (MTU exceed) --
NOS-16136.

Only the handlers OSS playbooks actually reach are ported. An unported
``custom_step_name`` raises and names what is supported, the same contract
``taac/driver/oss_coop_patcher.py`` applies to ``py_func_name``: a playbook
that needs a new handler gets it added here rather than silently running
against an unconfigured DUT.
