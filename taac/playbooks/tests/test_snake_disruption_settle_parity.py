"""Parity invariants for every snake playbook that interrupts a service.

Each such playbook must (a) wait for convergence of the service it just
disrupted and (b) settle before its postchecks run. Both were missing from
``test_snake_qsfp_service_restart``: it restarted qsfp_service but waited only
on AGENT, which was untouched and so returned immediately, and it had no
settle step. Postchecks therefore sampled while qsfp_service was still coming
up and missed its transceiver re-poll burst entirely -- the MAX-over-window
utilization checks reported a peak roughly half the real one.

The crash variants had both properties all along, so this is enforced as
parity across the whole family rather than as three separate assertions:
adding a new disruption playbook without them fails here.
