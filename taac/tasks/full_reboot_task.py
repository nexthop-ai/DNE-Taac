"""TAAC Task: full host reboot of a network device (or any SSH-reachable Linux host).

Issues `sudo systemctl reboot` over SSH to a hostname, then waits for the host
to become SSH-unreachable (confirming the reboot took effect) and waits for it
to come back up. Built for Phase 4-1 TC5 "U-server reboot" — which in the bash
harness rebootss the DUT switch as a Linux host (not a separate paired server).

The Task is generic over any SSH-reachable host: it bypasses the TAAC switch
driver factory by talking to `ParamikoClient(hostname)` directly. This makes it
usable for both DUT switch reboots and any non-topology host that needs the
same issue → wait-down → wait-up lifecycle.
