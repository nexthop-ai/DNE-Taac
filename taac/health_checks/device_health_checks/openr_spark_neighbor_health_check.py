    Validates that all expected Open/R Spark neighbors are ESTABLISHED.

    Expected neighbor count is resolved in this order:
    1. check_params["expected_neighbor_count"] — explicit override
    2. check_params["expected_neighbors"] — len of the explicit list
    3. len(obj.interfaces) — derived from topology (each interface = 1 neighbor)
    4. If none of the above, requires at least 1 neighbor.

    check_params:
        expected_neighbor_count (int): exact number of expected neighbors
        expected_neighbors (list[str]): optional list of expected neighbor node names
        allow_zero (bool): set True to allow 0 neighbors (e.g. isolated node test)
