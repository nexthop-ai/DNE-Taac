"""Single-DUT 1-RSW TestConfig generator.

`gen_rsw_test_config()` composes an OSS single-DUT RSW test config —
one DUT acting as a rack switch, peering eBGP with IXIA-emulated
neighbors over its downlink — by wrapping Meta's conveyor factory
(`test_config_for_bgp_and_fboss_platform_hardening_in_conveyor`) and
applying the OSS-specific adaptations in ONE reviewable place.

What this generator provides is **general to single-DUT RSW tests**
(not tied to any one playbook):

  * an IXIA-emulated eBGP block on BOTH ports (4 peers each: downlink at
    2001:db8:3::2..::5, uplink at 2001:db8:4::2..::5) + a single
    cross-port (downlink<->uplink) loss-probe traffic item;
  * the conveyor-factory wrapping (54 unused BGP-topology params → None),
    the BGP_SESSION_ESTABLISH_CHECK re-point at the IXIA peer ranges, the
    fresh-IXIA-setup (cache-off) safeguard, and a skip-list for checks
    with no OSS path yet.

The **playbook bundle is a parameter** (``playbooks=``). It defaults to
the agent-restart suite below, but any single-DUT RSW playbook set can
be passed — e.g. a longevity or feature-qual suite — reusing all of the
scaffolding above.

Note: the per-playbook check tuning (SERVICE_RESTART allowlist,
IXIA-loss ``clear``/``sleep`` windows) is keyed by the agent-restart
playbook *names* and no-ops for any other playbook — so those are
agent-restart-aware defaults, not general behavior. A different RSW
suite that needs its own loss/restart tuning would extend
``_annotate_check`` / the per-playbook spec dicts accordingly.

This is the RSW analogue of `taac/testconfigs/snake/test_test_config.py`
(`gen_snake_test_config`): the caller (an OSS config in
`taac/testconfigs/oss/`) resolves the DUT + IXIA wiring from the
topology/CSVs and passes them in as plain args; all the Meta-factory
adaptation lives here so the OSS config file stays a thin
topology-picker and this file is the single merge-conflict surface on
upstream sync.

Default playbook bundle (overridable via ``playbooks=``; see
`taac.playbooks.playbook_definitions`):
  - TEST_FBOSS_SW_AGENT_WARMBOOT_PLAYBOOK   (Service.FBOSS_SW_AGENT)
  - TEST_FBOSS_SW_AGENT_CRASH_PLAYBOOK      (Service.FBOSS_SW_AGENT)
  - TEST_FBOSS_HW_AGENT_0_RESTART_PLAYBOOK  (Service.FBOSS_HW_AGENT_0)
  - TEST_FBOSS_HW_AGENT_0_CRASH_PLAYBOOK    (Service.FBOSS_HW_AGENT_0)

The remaining 54 BGP-topology params of the factory are required args
but are only consumed by the factory's default playbook chain (replaced
by our explicit `playbooks`) and the BGP-specific tc_pre/postchecks — so
all 54 are passed as ``None``.

BGP_SESSION_ESTABLISH_CHECK fires against 8 IXIA-emulated peers
(remote-AS 65000): 4 downlink peers at ``2001:db8:3::2..::5`` and 4
uplink peers at ``2001:db8:4::2..::5``, peering with the DUT-side bgpd
(AS 65001) at ``2001:db8:3::1/64`` / ``2001:db8:4::1/64``. The DUT-side
agent.conf + ``/etc/coop/bgpcpp.conf`` must be pre-provisioned with that
L3 addressing and 4 BGP peer entries per port (see
nh-internal/testbed_configs/1-RSW/); the IXIA side is brought up by the
runner from the ``basic_port_configs`` blocks attached here.

# * POST-RECOVERY only (``clear=True``) — events that DO disrupt the datapath
#   because the hardware agent restarts and the ASIC is reprogrammed; the signal
#   is clean forwarding ONCE recovered. ``sleep_time`` sizes that window.
#     - sw_agent CRASH: on the wedge800 split-agent DUT, ``pkill -9
#       fboss_sw_agent`` cascades into a fboss_hw_agent@0 restart via the
#       FSDB coupling, so the ASIC gets reprogrammed and traffic is

#       original spec here was ``clear=False`` based on the "hw_agent + ASIC
#       keep forwarding" assumption from a different platform; live smoke on
#       crow242 disproved that assumption for this wedge800 build. Measure
#       post-recovery only, matching the other agent-crash playbooks.
#     - hw_agent restart / crash (60s — heavier ASIC reprogram).
#     - generic agent crash (``Service.AGENT`` -> ``pkill -9 -f fboss_`` kills
#       BOTH sw AND hw agent on this split/multi-switch DUT, so the hw agent
#       restarts and traffic is interrupted by design; 30s window).
#     - generic agent warmboot (``Service.AGENT`` SYSTEMCTL_RESTART -> on this
#       split/multi-switch DUT ``async_restart_service`` fans out to restart
#       BOTH ``fboss_sw_agent`` + ``fboss_hw_agent@0``; the hw-agent restart
#       reinits the ASIC, so ~1-2k pkts are dropped transiently and forwarding
#       recovers — measure post-recovery like the hw_agent restart (60s). NOTE:
#       this is NOT a "pure" warmboot (which would be lossless); it includes a
#       hw-agent restart by our chosen AGENT->both-agents mapping. If a lossless
#       control-plane-only warmboot is wanted instead, map AGENT->fboss_sw_agent
#       only in async_restart_service (then this would move to clear=False).
