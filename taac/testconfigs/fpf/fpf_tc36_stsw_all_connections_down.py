"""TC36: All STSW Connections Down Simultaneously.

Shuts EVERY gtsw001.l1002.c087.mwg2 -> stsw001.s001.l202.mwg2 uplink interface
AT ONCE (a single batched thrift port-disable run ON the GTSW), so the whole
GTSW<->STSW plane-1 trunk drops in one step rather than one link at a time.
This is the "lose an entire spine-side connection bundle" failure: the impacted
GTSW lane (lane 0) loses its STSW uplink set wholesale.

The LLDP query + disable is performed from the GTSW side (the test owner's
request): on gtsw001, resolve the uplinks facing stsw001.s001 and shut them.

DISRUPTION MECHANISM (runtime LLDP):
  Uses ``create_fpf_lldp_batched_set_interface_admin_step``: at step run time,
  on ``DUT_GTSW`` (gtsw001), the handler enumerates LLDP neighbors and matches
  the remote system name against ``MEMBER_NEIGHBOR_PATTERN`` (fnmatch glob over
  the specific STSW plane being downed, ``"stsw001.s001*"``) to get gtsw001's
  local uplink interfaces facing that STSW, then issues a SINGLE batched
  ``async_thrift_disable_enable_interfaces`` call over the resolved tuple.
  Broadening the pattern to ``"stsw*"`` would down ALL planes' uplinks at once;
  we scope to the single plane under test.
  "Batched" here means one ``async_agent_client`` context with sequential
  per-port ``setPortState`` calls (FBOSS exposes no list-RPC), the same
  primitive used by the held-admin-down step. No COOP config patcher — that
  only patches config and needs reload/warmboot to actually shut the port.

EXPECTATIONS (mirror the STSW/GTSW DEVICE-DRAIN test, TC19, with the
all-connections-down nuances):
  - The directly-injected test prefixes on the impacted lane (lane 0) are
    WITHDRAWN from the bulk/prod collectors of THAT (impacted) lane — those
    collectors no longer see lane-0 prefixes. They instead surface in the
    REMOTE-FAILURE collector (lane 0 rises 0->prefix_count), which is exactly
    the "impacted lane appears in the remote-failure view, not in the
    bulk/prod view" contract. ``impacted_lanes=[0]`` +
    ``injected_prefixes_withdrawn=True`` drives the bulk-withdrawal assertion
    and the remote-failure rise on lane 0.
  - Prod/broad prefix: impacted plane (lane 0) goes reachable->unreachable
    within the transition SLA on the impacted host.
  - FSDB/HRT session: shutting gtsw001's UPLINKS to stsw001 does NOT drop the
    GPU<->GTSW HRT FSDB sessions — those ride the gtsw DOWNLINKS, which stay up;
    sessions stay all-CONNECTED. ``flip_fsdb_session=False`` (as before; mirrors
    TC19 device-drain).
  - ODS discards (in_discard / in_dst_null): packet loss is EXPECTED on the
    impacted plane but is RECORDED non-failing, mirroring the
    ``ods_discard_informational`` knob on the service-restart playbook. Both
    DISCARD checks are added with ``informational=True`` (breach -> PASS with
    an ``[INFORMATIONAL]`` prefix instead of FAIL). The two CONGESTION checks
    stay hard (a link event must not cause congestion). ``flip_discards`` is
    left at False so the hard ``loss>=threshold`` "assert loss occurred"
    counter (used by tc15/tc37) is NOT added — the informational discards
    record the same loss without failing.
  - Host-spray + all other generic HCs: same as the device-drain test.

Two-playbook shape (disrupt-only + stable-state restore), mirroring TC15/TC19:
the disrupt playbook performs the batched STSW shut + settle + effectiveness
gate; the restore playbook re-enables the whole member set and validates full
stable-state recovery.

Assumptions:
  - Member interfaces are resolved live from LLDP on ``DUT_GTSW`` (gtsw001);
    the config no longer carries a static member list. ``MEMBER_NEIGHBOR_PATTERN``
    (``"stsw001.s001*"``) is a fnmatch glob over the LLDP remote system name,
    scoped to the single STSW plane under test.
  - Batched-at-once semantics: a single
    ``async_thrift_disable_enable_interfaces`` call over the resolved tuple
    issues sequential per-port ``setPortState`` calls inside ONE
    ``async_agent_client`` context — "simultaneous" within the limits of the
    FBOSS thrift API (no list-RPC exists).
  - Informational discard semantics use ``ods_discard_informational=True``
    (record-but-never-fail) on the link-event playbook. ``flip_discards`` is
    False so the hard ``loss>=threshold`` "loss expected" check is not added
    alongside the informational discards.
