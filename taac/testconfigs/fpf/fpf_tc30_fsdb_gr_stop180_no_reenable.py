"""TC30: FSDB GR timer beyond window — stop fsdb 5min, do NOT re-enable.

Stops ``fsdb`` (systemctl stop) on gtsw001 and holds it stopped for 300s (5m) —
beyond the FSDB graceful-restart grace window — and never starts it back. The 5m
hold IS the observation window (there is NO separate longevity playbook). fsdb
owns lane 0 (gtsw001 -> lane 0 = ``beth0`` on the GPU NIC hosts), so past GR expiry
lane 0 of all 4 GPUs stays withdrawn and the impaired steady state persists,
exactly like an interface disable that is left down (compare to the fpf_tc15
interface-disable DISRUPT playbook): bulk/fsdb on lane 0 withdrawn, remote-failure
shows the impacted lane, the HRT CONNECTED FSDB-session census settles at 28
(32 - 4) and STAYS there with no recovery, AND — the added data-plane signal —
beth0 egress DRAINS (< 10 Gbps) on the GPU host cabled to gtsw001 while its
lanes 1-3 keep spraying (> 75 Gbps). The other GPU host's beth0 lands on a
DIFFERENT plane-0 GTSW (confirmed by LLDP: only GPU_HOSTS[0] neighbors gtsw001),
so it is UNAFFECTED — all 4 of its lanes hold > 75 Gbps, which also validates
that the disruption's blast radius stays local to the host on gtsw001.

Two distinct timescales (validated on the testbed — keep them separate):
  - Control plane (the FSDB session census): the transition is IMMEDIATE. On
    `systemctl stop fsdb` the per-host CONNECTED count drops 32 -> 28 (lane 0 of
    all 4 GPUs goes to 0) within ~4s. It does NOT wait for the GR grace window —
    the ~120s grace is purely a routes/data-plane forwarding hold. The session
    collector confirms: only the single poll captured AT the stop instant reads
    32; every later sample reads 28. So the stays-down session check skips the
    first SESSION_WINDOW_OFFSET_SEC (10s) to exclude that boundary sample and
    asserts a clean steady 28.
  - Data plane (beth0 egress): held by GR for ~120s, then purged. The host-spray
    check therefore reads at the END of the 5m hold with an avg(30s),latest
    transform — well past the purge, with a tight averaging window so the drained
    reading isn't smeared across the transition.

This config is meant to run BEFORE fpf_tc31 (which re-enables fsdb and validates
recovery). It deliberately leaves fsdb DOWN.

Structure & the "stays at 28, no recovery" mapping (READ — this is a deliberate
deviation from a naive single-playbook session-stat check):

  The session-stat check's "disruption" mode ALWAYS evaluates Signal 2 (the count
  must RECOVER to expected_connected and hold for recovery_min_sec). There is no
  knob to disable Signal 2 — even recovery_min_sec=0 still requires the census to
  reach expected_connected (32). Since tc30 never re-enables fsdb, the census never
  returns to 32, so a disruption-mode check would always FAIL on Signal 2. That is
  NOT the contract we want to assert here ("stays at 28").

  The faithful mapping the check actually supports is mode="stable" with
  expected_connected=28: it asserts min==max==28 across the window with NO recovery
  requirement — i.e. the impaired census holds steady at 28. To scope that window
  to AFTER the stop (so the pre-stop 32 samples are excluded), the stays-down
  checks set window_from_disruption_time=True + window_duration_sec=
  STOP_DURATION_SEC, so they evaluate exactly [disruption_time,
  disruption_time+300] — the 5m hold. The session check additionally sets
  window_offset_sec=10 to drop the stop-instant boundary sample. The host-spray
  check uses the same scoped window (latest avg(30s) at the END of the hold) to
  assert the lane-0-drained / lanes-1-3-hold data-plane state.

  Two-playbook structure is kept: a disruption playbook (inject/stabilize/stop/
  hold 300s) that CARRIES the stays-down postchecks, followed by a minimal
  no-step playbook (preserves the structure, carries no checks). There is no
  stable-state hardening longevity here: fsdb is intentionally left down, so the
  FULL stable contract (which expects 32) does not apply.

ASSUMPTIONS:
  - mode="stable" + expected_connected=28 is the supported "stays at 28, no
    recovery" mapping (disruption mode cannot express "no recovery"; see above).
  - The FSDB session census drops to 28 within ~4s of the stop (control-plane
    transition is immediate); window_offset_sec=10 excludes the stop-instant
    boundary sample so the stable check sees a clean steady 28.
  - The 300s hold exceeds the FSDB GR window (~120s), so lane 0 routes are fully
    purged within the hold; the end-of-hold avg(30s),latest reading shows beth0
    drained.
  - window_from_disruption_time scopes both stays-down checks to the 5m hold
    ([disruption_time, disruption_time+300]), excluding pre-stop healthy samples.

Headless run stops fsdb via SSH/systemctl — kick off from a Kerberos-ticketed
terminal.
