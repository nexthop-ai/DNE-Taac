OSS-Specific Exceptions

Custom exception classes for the OSS TAAC entry point.

Exception classification logic (mapping exceptions to OSSTestStatus,
identifying infra vs user errors) lives in oss_exception_classifier.py
so this module doesn't need to import oss_test_status.py.

    Configuration error.

    Infrastructure error.

    Transient error that may succeed on retry.

    Raised for temporary failures that might be resolved by retrying,
