"""
OSS-safe BGP config modifiers for FBOSS devices.

Soft-drain and undrain a device without any Meta-internal dependency -- no
LocalDrainer, no config_selector, no COOP. The only primitive we rely on is the
launch convention: bgpd reads ``--config /dev/shm/fboss/bgpcpp_startup_config``,
which is a symlink.

A drain is therefore three things:

1. Update the ``/dev/shm/fboss`` drain markers.
2. Repoint the startup-config symlink at the corresponding config file.
3. Restart bgpd.

Both config files (live and soft-drain) must already exist on the device.
``setup_base_configs`` produces them: it reads the device's current BGP config,
replaces whatever policies it had with three generalized propagate policies,
points every peer group and peer at them, and writes back a live copy and a
soft-drain copy that differ only in their egress policy and drain state.
Drain/undrain then just selects between those two files.

Call these from a TAAC step or task with the device's driver::

    # step: Step.setUp already populated self.driver
    await setup_base_configs(self.driver)
    await drain_device(self.driver)

    # task: build one from the hostname
    driver = await async_get_device_driver(hostname)
    await drain_device(driver)
